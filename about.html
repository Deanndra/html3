	<h2>About Website</h2>
	</header>
	<article>
	<p> What made me wanna build this website was when I was texting with my father and he was telling me how he was lonely and didn't have no one else to talk with. I then remembered how I used to watch him enjoy playing on the playstation all the time when I was younger, so when I told him about gaming again he replied that he was "too old". It makes me sad how people tend think that these challenges keep them from enjoying the things they want to try or do. So I decided to at least persuade others to try gaming by building a website dedicated to help them get started.</p> 
		<p>This website is intended for beginner gamers of all people no matter the age, race, gender, etc. I want people to at least experience the world of gaming like I did by joining communities, meeting new people, and gaining a new interest/hobby. I hope my website can help people who are new to gaming and get them started on this path.</p>
		<h3>*DISCLAIMER*</h3>
		<p>This website was built for a assignment for my Web Design class. I am fairly new to coding so my website may look not promising and messy, so plz be nice.</p>
